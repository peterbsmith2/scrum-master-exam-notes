- "and progress toward a Sprint Goal"

### Adaptation

## 4 Formal Events
### Sprint Planning
- "What can be done?"

- Sprint Goal: Objective achievable by implementation of Product Backlog
### Daily Scrum
- 15 minutes
- inspect and adapt
- does not require the Product Owner
- does not require the Scrum Master
### Sprint Review
- inspect Increment
- adapt the Product Backlog
- 4 hrs / month, 2 hrs / 2 weeks, 1 hr / week

## Three Artifacts
### Product Backlog
- everything thats to be done
- refinement no more than 10% of dev team capacity
- Development Team is responsible for all estimates. Product Owner may influence the development team to understand tradeoffs, but the people doing the work are the ones who make the final estimate
- all work is summable, optionally made into burndowns, burnups, and cumulative flows
- updates can be made at any time by the Product Owner

### Sprint Backlog
- PB items for Sprint
- includes at least one high priority process improvement identified at the Retrospective
- only Dev Team modifies

### Increments
- must be in usable condition regardless of whether Product Owner decides to release

## Artifact Transparency
- Scrum Master ensures transparency of Sprint Backlog, Product Backlog, Increments
- "This work usually includes learning, convincing and changing"

## DoD
- Defined by Dev Team, not Organization
- over time Done increases in quality and criteria
