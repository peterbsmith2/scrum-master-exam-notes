# General

## Glossary 
> Includes words I haven't seen so far in my reading

**Coherence:** The quality of the relationship between certain Product Backlog items which may make them worthy of consideration as a whole. See also: Sprint Goal  
**Ready:** a shared understanding by the Product Owner and the Development Team regarding the preferred level of description of Product Backlog items introduced at Sprint Planning  
**Scrum Board:** a physical board to visualize information for and by the Scrum Team, often used to manage Sprint Backlog. Scrum boards are an optional implementation within Scrum to make the information visible.  
**Stakeholder:** a person external to the Scrum Team with a specific interest in and knowledge of a product that is required for incremental discovery. Represented by the Product Owner and actively engaged with the Scrum Team at Sprint Review.  
**Velocity:** an optional, but often used, of the average amount of Product BBacklog turned into an Increment of product during a Sprint by a Scrum Team, tracked by the Development Team for use within the Scrum Team  

## ScrumButs
- Reasons why teams can't use the full dictation of Scrum
- Take the form (ScrumBut)(Reason)(Workaround)

Examples 
- "(We use Scrum, but) (Retrospectives are a waste of time,) (so we don't do them.)"

## Including an outside team member
[Reference](https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/5840/question-dev-team-needs-help-outside)

> When a team can't solve a specific technical problem, it implies that the resolution lies outside of their control and is therefore an impediment. Both of the solutions you suggest are appropriate techniques for impediment removal. The team would need to inspect and adapt their process, no later than the Sprint Retrospective, so that similar impediments do not arise again. This may involve training, changes in available resources, changes in the Definition of Done, and/or changes in the process for accepting work into their Sprint Backlog.

## 20 Unagile Things to Avoid Saying and Some Better Alternatives
[Link](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/20-unagile-things-avoid-saying-and-some-better-alternatives)

- Sprint Backlog is a "plan" or "forecast" not a "commitment"
- avoid special sprints like "sprint zero," "integration sprint," "testing sprint," just called them stages or phases
- avoid calling Sprint Review a "demo"
- Acceptance criteria for a Product Backlog item is not the same as DoD
- Sprints are meant to deliver Increments of value, not Releases. The decision to release is meant to be made on a Just in Time basis
- avoid "distributed" teams. a team which is not co-located is a dislocated team. Call it that, and be clear about it.
- avoid dehumanizing employees as "resources" or "work packages"

## For Product Owner
### Release Planning and Predictable Delivery

- "you can only really know how long something took after it has been completed."
- look at previous work to make forecasts
- three sizes for estimate: trivial, fits in sprint, does not fit in sprint
- focus on backlog refinement for facilitating flow of actionable Product Backlog items to your team
